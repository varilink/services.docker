Group vars situated alongside the `install-services.yml` playbook in the *distributed* test environment provided by *Services - Docker*. Here we define variables that are specific to the *home* domain rather than in the inventory variables files. If they were defined in the inventory they would clash with variables for the *customer* domain when we run playbooks in the *customer* project.
